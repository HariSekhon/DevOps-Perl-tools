-- List of keywords to re-case for Presto

-- used by prestocase.pl

-- Regex one per line of keywords to re-case by literal replacement
-- whitespace is converted to \s+ for matching so this list can look cleaner
-- leading/trailing whitespace is automatically trimmed
-- don't specify functions such as COUNT() with brackets since brackets are added as one of several possible keyword boundaries
