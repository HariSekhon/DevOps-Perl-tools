# Operating System should be set to Ubuntu, not Amazon Linux 2
# - this is both recommended since programming language runtimes are now included in standard image of ubuntu, but also to avoid this error:
#
#     /usr/bin/amazon-linux-extras
#     /root/.pyenv/versions/3.8.3/bin/python: No module named amazon_linux_extras

version: 0.2

# only on Linux, the user to run as - global setting, alternatively set inside a phase section below for localized user
#run-as: linux-username

env:
  shell: bash
  # don't store sensitive stuff like AWS secret keys in variables, use parameter-store or secrets-manager
  # any environment variables replace existing environment variables, ie. beware if setting PATH that it'll replace the existing PATH with a non-interpolated literal
  # project env vars take precedence over these, with start build vars taking highest precedence
  #variables:
  #  DEBUG: "1"
  #exported-variables:
  #  - DEBUG

phases:
  # install prerequisites / languages / frameworks / packages to allow build to work
  install:
    #commands:
    #  - setup/ci_bootstrap.sh
    # languages to install
    runtime-versions:
      #java: openjdk11
      # AWS LTS release of OpenJDK 11
      java: corretto11
      golang: 1.14
      python: 3.8
      ruby: 2.7
  # eg. sign in to Amazon ECR or install package dependencies
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - setup/ci_bootstrap.sh
  build:
    commands:
      - echo Build started on `date`
      - make
      - echo Build completed on `date`
      - make test
      - echo Tests completed on `date`
