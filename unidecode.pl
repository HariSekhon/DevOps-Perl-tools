$DESCRIPTION="Converts UTF characters to ASCII

Works as a standard unix filter program, reading from file arguments or standard input and printing to standard output

Known Issues: uses the Text::Unidecode CPAN module, which seems to convert unknown chars to \"a\"

See also unidecode.py (pip install unidecode) which contains a CLI program to do this";

$VERSION = "0.6.3";
