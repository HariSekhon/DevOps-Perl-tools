$DESCRIPTION="Tool for converting PDF to text for text analytics. Rustled this up quickly in Cloudera to analyze our internal KB for an unofficial topic challenge, which I won as a result of using this and a Java MapReduce word count :)

Operates as a standard unix filter program taking any number of PDF files as arguments (or -f/--pdf comma separated files or PDF content in standard input) and outputting the text to standard output.

See also Apache PDFBox and pdf2text unix tool";
